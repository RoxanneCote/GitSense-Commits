# Activity Summary for 11/28/2025

## 7:44:53 AM
The provided log details recent changes to a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testing framework, primarily focusing on Battery Management Unit (BMU) control, test execution, and documentation.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\calogy_ws\HIL_Tester\src\scripts\hardware\bmu\bmu_control.py`**:
    *   (11/26/2025, 12:18:40 PM): Initial code for the `BMUControl` class, handling CAN communication, DBC decoding, signal caching, and methods for sending/receiving messages, printing available messages, and controlling contactors (open/close). It also includes functions to read BMU temperatures, battery voltage, and load voltage.
    *   (11/27/2025, 10:31:01 AM - 11:02:55 AM): Multiple minor changes, likely whitespace or comment adjustments, and the removal of the `dataclasses.dataclass` import as it's not used directly in the `BMUControl` class definition. The `read_load_voltage` method was slightly truncated in some entries, but the overall functionality remained consistent.
    *   (11/27/2025, 11:13:36 AM - 2:17:47 PM): Added a docstring for the `BMUControl` class itself and further minor code formatting changes, such as line breaks in `can.Message` instantiation for `send_message` and `send_periodic` functions, and in the `receive_message`'s unknown ID return dictionary. These changes aim for better readability and style.

*   **`c:\calogy_ws\HIL_Tester\tests\hil_tests\test_bmu_control.py`**:
    *   (11/26/2025, 12:20:18 PM): Initial set of Pytest tests for `BMUControl`, covering battery voltage, load voltage (both pass and fail scenarios), CMU voltage statistics, coin cell presence (time retention after power cycle), and BMU temperatures. It uses a `print_test` helper for formatted output.
    *   (11/27/2025, 10:40:03 AM - 10:42:54 AM): Minor formatting adjustments, particularly regarding dictionary literal spacing (e.g., `GLOBAL_STATE_NAMES`).
    *   (11/27/2025, 10:59:56 AM - 2:22:06 PM): Changed the `eol_bench` fixture parameter name to `_eol_bench` in multiple test functions (`test_read_battery_voltage`, `test_read_load_voltage_failed`, `test_read_load_voltage`, `test_set_bmu_time`, `test_read_bmu_temperatures`). This change typically indicates that the fixture is used but its direct value is not referenced within the function body, following common pytest conventions for unused arguments.
    *   (11/27/2025, 2:38:37 PM - 3:10:29 PM): Removed the `eol_bench` fixture from `test_read_cmu_voltage_stats`, `test_read_load_voltage_failed`, `test_read_load_voltage`, `test_read_bmu_temperatures`, `test_open_contactor`, and `test_close_contactor` functions. This implies these specific tests no longer require or directly interact with the `eol_bench` fixture's returned object, potentially simplifying dependencies or refactoring. The `test_set_bmu_time` test continues to use `eol_bench`.

*   **`c:\calogy_ws\HIL_Tester\src\scripts\hil_runner\README.md`**:
    *   (11/27/2025, 9:26:12 AM): Comprehensive README for the HIL Runner GUI, describing its purpose, features (GUI, barcode scanning, flashing, reporting, bilingual support), installation steps (prerequisites, Python dependencies), and how to run it. It also includes a detailed "File Summary" table and lists dependencies and outputs. This indicates the HIL Runner is a central component of the framework.

*   **`c:\calogy_ws\HIL_Tester\src\scripts\hil_runner\localization.py`**:
    *   (11/27/2025, 9:31:45 AM - 9:35:32 AM): Minor changes, mainly updating the module docstring from `Internationalization (i18n)` to `Localization (l10n)` for consistency. The actual `LOCALIZATION` dictionary contents (English and French UI strings) remain the same.

*   **`c:\calogy_ws\HIL_Tester\.gitignore`**:
    *   (11/27/2025, 9:46:43 AM): Expanded `.gitignore` file, adding specific ignores for HIL Runner reports (`reports/`) and firmware/releases directories (`011-0015-LPack_BMS_Firmware/`, `releases_latest/`).
    *   (11/27/2025, 9:50:21 AM): Further refinement of `.gitignore`, adding more detailed comments for PyInstaller, pipenv, UV, poetry, and pdm sections, clarifying why certain lock files might be included or excluded from version control. Also, a specific ignore for `report/*.html` was commented out as `reports/` already covers it.

*   **`c:\calogy_ws\HIL_Tester\README.md`**:
    *   (11/27/2025, 9:52:49 AM - 9:55:56 AM): Significant updates to the main project README, changing "layered architecture" to "blocked architecture" and then to "modular block structure" and "Project Modules" to better describe the framework's design. The document outlines the project's purpose, layered architecture (Config, HIL Scripts, Runner GUI, EOL Bench, CAN, BMU, Tests), prerequisites (Docker, Python, CAN interface, Git SSH, STM32\_Programmer\_CLI), Docker environment details, Python dependencies (including specific testing, CAN, analysis, and utility libraries), and CAN interface setup. It provides a comprehensive overview of the HIL\_Tester framework.

*   **`c:\calogy_ws\HIL_Tester\src\scripts\hil_runner\__init__.py`**:
    *   (11/27/2025, 10:33:40 AM - 1:52:37 PM): Multiple iterations of `__init__.py` file updates. Initially, it used `from .config import *` style imports, then switched to explicit imports (`from .config import HILRunConfig`) and managed `__all__` list explicitly. The module docstring was also refined to better explain the package's purpose and modules.

*   **`c:\calogy_ws\HIL_Tester\.vscode\settings.json`**:
    *   (11/27/2025, 10:34:00 AM - 10:34:11 AM): Reordered `python.linting.flake8Args` entry within the file, moving it from outside to inside the global settings scope. The content remains the same.

*   **`c:\calogy_ws\HIL_Tester\pyproject.toml`**:
    *   (11/27/2025, 10:36:21 AM): Initial version of `pyproject.toml`, configuring `pylint` to disable `C0301` (line-too-long), `pytest` options (pythonpath, addopts), `mypy` settings (python version, warnings), build system requirements, and project metadata (name, version, description, readme, python requirement, dependencies, URLs).
    *   (11/27/2025, 2:12:59 PM): Added `W0718` (`broad-exception-caught`) to the `pylint` disable list, indicating an allowance for broader exception handling in the codebase.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **HIL Testing Framework:** The core theme across all changes is the development and refinement of a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testing framework for a Battery Management Unit (BMU).
*   **Pytest Integration:** Pytest is consistently used for defining and executing tests, with `conftest.py` playing a crucial role in managing fixtures, command-line options (`--dbc-path`, `--product-model`, `--dut-serial`), and metadata for HTML reports.
*   **DBC Files:** DBC files are central to the CAN communication and decoding, mentioned repeatedly in `bmu_control.py`, `conftest.py`, and the `README.md` files as a critical dependency for interpreting CAN signals. There's a clear emphasis on configuring and falling back to default DBC paths.
*   **Documentation Focus:** A significant portion of the changes involves creating or expanding `README.md` files (`HIL_Tester\README.md`, `hil_scripts\README.md`, `src\scripts\hil_runner\README.md`, `src\scripts\hardware\bmu\README.md`, `tests\hil_tests\README.md`). This indicates a strong effort to document the project's architecture, usage, and testing methodologies.
*   **Modular/Layered Architecture:** The main `README.md` explicitly describes a "modular block structure" (initially "layered architecture") with defined responsibilities for Config, HIL Scripts, Runner GUI, EOL Bench, CAN, BMU, and Tests. This pattern of organizing code into decoupled components is evident.
*   **GUI for EOL/HIL (HIL Runner):** The `src\scripts\hil_runner\runner.py` and its associated `README.md` highlight a Tkinter-based GUI for interactive test execution, barcode scanning, and optional firmware flashing, positioned as the recommended interface for End-of-Line (EOL) testing.
*   **GitHub Releases/Firmware Management:** `HILReleaseFetcher` in `release_fetcher.py` and references in `runner.py` indicate a system for downloading firmware releases from GitHub, supporting both API and `gh` CLI for private repositories.
*   **Code Quality & Best Practices:** The updates include linting configuration (`pyproject.toml` for pylint), docstring additions (`runner.py`, `helpers.py`, `__init__.py` files), and explicit handling of unused fixture parameters (e.g., `_eol_bench`), suggesting a focus on code quality, maintainability, and adhering to Python/pytest conventions.
*   **Test Reporting:** Customizations to `pytest-html` reports (title, environment metadata, summary banner) are present in `conftest.py`, showing a commitment to generating detailed and user-friendly test reports. The `report_printer_helper.py` also supports formatted console output for tests.
*   **Bench Control:** The `EOLBenchController` is used to manage hardware power supplies (12V and 48V for BMU) for setting up and tearing down the test environment, indicating real hardware interaction.

## 9:44:31 AM
The project `HIL_Tester` underwent significant development over two days, primarily focusing on its Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testing framework, particularly for Battery Management Unit (BMU) control and associated test infrastructure.

    *   **11/27/2025, 2:22:52 PM**: Created to provide a `ReportPrinter` class with a static method `print_test` for consistent test result formatting.

*   **`c:\calogy_ws\HIL_Tester\hil_scripts\README.md`**:
    *   **11/27/2025, 2:51:06 PM**: A comprehensive guide covering various HIL test execution methods (GUI, interactive shell, Docker, CI/CD, remote publishing), first-time setup instructions, detailed report specifications (HTML, JUnit XML, naming conventions, location), CAN interface setup, and a universal workflow for HIL scripts.

*   **`c:\calogy_ws\HIL_Tester\tests\hil_tests\README.md`**:
    *   **11/27/2025, 3:04:54 PM**: Provides guidelines for HIL tests, specifically for BMU. It outlines test coverage, environment variables used, methods for configuring DBC files (required tests, path options, default fallback), test organization (categories), pytest markers (`@pytest.mark.can`, `.hil`, `.dbc`, `.slow`), and fixtures (`bmu`, `record_metadata`). It also details the metadata included in HTML reports.

**Patterns and recurring elements:**

1.  **Refactoring and Modularity**: A clear pattern of refactoring helper functions and utilities into dedicated modules (e.g., `src/scripts/hil_runner/helpers.py`) and classes (`HILHelper`). This improves code organization and reusability. The `__init__.py` files also reflect a move from wildcard imports to explicit imports, enhancing module API clarity.
2.  **Pytest-centric Testing**: Pytest is the core testing framework, utilized for test definition (`test_bmu_control.py`), fixture management (`conftest.py`), and report generation (`pytest-html`, `pytest-metadata`). Custom command-line options and metadata recording are integral to the testing process.
3.  **CAN Communication and DBC Files**: The Battery Management Unit (BMU) control is heavily reliant on CAN communication and DBC (CAN database) files for message decoding. The DBC path is a configurable option for tests and the GUI.
4.  **HIL and EOL Focus**: The project is explicitly designed for Hardware-in-the-Loop and End-of-Line testing, indicated by file paths (`HIL_Tester`, `eol_bench`), module names (`hil_runner`), and documentation.
5.  **Comprehensive Documentation**: Extensive `README.md` files are maintained at various levels (`hil_scripts`, `tests/hil_tests`, `src/scripts/hardware/bmu`) to guide users on setup, execution, and reporting.
6.  **GUI Development**: A Tkinter-based GUI (`runner.py`/`runner_controller.py`) is a central component for interacting with the HIL system, including features like barcode scanning, firmware flashing, and real-time logging.
7.  **Firmware Release Management**: `HILReleaseFetcher` is responsible for fetching and extracting firmware releases, including ELF and DBC files, from GitHub repositories.
8.  **Consistent Timestamps**: The clustered timestamps on `11/27/2025` and `11/28/2025` suggest a focused development sprint or a series of coordinated changes across the codebase.
9.  **Fixture Renaming Consistency**: The change from `_eol_bench` to `eol_bench` in `conftest.py` was systematically propagated to relevant test files.
