# Activity Summary for 11/27/2025

## 7:09:14 AM
The project's codebase, `HIL_Tester`, is undergoing active development related to a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testing framework for Battery Management Units (BMU). This activity is concentrated between 10:54 AM and 12:20 PM on November 26, 2025.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\calogy_ws\HIL_Tester\src\scripts\hil_runner\i18n.py` (10:54:12 AM, 11:08:00 AM):** This file defines the internationalization (i18n) strings for the HIL Runner GUI, supporting both English and French. The content remained consistent across the two timestamps, indicating its initial stable definition or a resave without functional changes.
*   **`c:\calogy_ws\HIL_Tester\.vscode\settings.json` (11:09:02 AM):** This VSCode configuration file was updated to enforce code formatting (`editor.formatOnSave: true`, `black-formatter` with `--line-length 160`), set default formatters for Python and shell scripts, and configure `cSpell` with English and French dictionaries, including specific custom words like "Calogy" and "pytest".
*   **`c:\calogy_ws\HIL_Tester\src\scripts\hil_runner\runner.py` (11:08:25 AM):** This core Python script for the HIL Runner GUI received a significant update. It now includes:
    *   Detailed documentation outlining its purpose: barcode scanning, optional firmware flashing, pytest execution, and live logging.
    *   Integration with `EOLBenchController` for hardware initialization, specifically turning on 12V BMU power at startup.
    *   Logic (`_ensure_latest_release_files`) to dynamically fetch and manage the latest firmware (ELF) and CAN database (DBC) files, extracting them from zip archives if necessary.
    *   Expansion of the GUI build (`_build_ui`) to include language selection, barcode/model/serial number input, confirmation/clear actions, and a visual "status light" for tests.
*   **`c:\calogy_ws\HIL_Tester\README.md` (11:09:02 AM):** This comprehensive documentation file was updated to provide an in-depth overview of the `HIL_Tester` project. It details the system's purpose for BMU validation, its layered architecture (Config, HIL Scripts, Runner GUI, EOL Bench, CAN, BMU, Tests), prerequisites (Docker, Python 3.11+, CAN hardware, Git SSH, STM32_Programmer_CLI), Python dependencies, and CAN interface setup procedures.
*   **`c:\calogy_ws\HIL_Tester\report.html` (11:09:08 AM - 11:11:05 AM):** Multiple entries for this file show an HTML test report generated by `pytest-html v4.1.1`. The report indicates 30 passed tests in 29 seconds, with environment details (Python 3.12.7, various pytest plugins). The content of the report remained identical across subsequent timestamps, suggesting these were likely automated saves or refreshes of an existing report.
*   **`c:\calogy_ws\HIL_Tester\.vscode\extensions.json` (11:11:23 AM):** This file was updated to recommend a list of VSCode extensions crucial for the project, including formatters (`shfmt`, `black-formatter`), development tools (`vscode-drawio`, `vscode-pylance`, `python`, `python-essentials`), and Git enhancements (`gitlens`, `git-prefix`).
*   **`c:\calogy_ws\HIL_Tester\src\scripts\hardware\bmu\bmu_control.py` (12:07:16 PM, 12:17:41 PM, 12:18:40 PM):** This Python script manages CAN communication and DBC decoding for the BMU. Key functionalities include:
    *   Initialization of the CAN bus and loading of DBC files.
    *   A background receiver thread (`_rx_loop`) to continuously cache incoming messages.
    *   Methods for sending and receiving CAN messages, including periodic messages.
    *   Specific functions for controlling BMU contactors (`open_contactor`, `close_contactor`, `open_close_contractor`).
    *   Functions to read various BMU data like temperatures, battery voltage, and load voltage.
    *   A notable comment indicates a change in `contactor_state_map` from string comparisons to raw integer comparisons.
    The file content remained consistent across the latter two timestamps, indicating resaves without changes.
*   **`c:\calogy_ws\HIL_Tester\tests\hil_tests\test_bmu_control.py` (12:11:11 PM, 12:20:18 PM):** This file contains Pytest tests for the `BMUControl` class. It defines various test thresholds and requirements (e.g., battery current, global state, voltages, temperatures). New tests include validation for battery voltage, load voltage (with a simulated fail case), CMU voltage statistics, coin cell presence (testing RTC retention across power cycles), and BMU temperatures. A minor update at 12:20:18 PM added imports for `Dict` and `Optional` from the `typing` module for improved type hinting.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

The period between 11:08:25 AM and 12:20:18 PM on November 26, 2025, shows significant activity. Key functional and documentation updates occurred around:
*   **11:08:25 AM:** `runner.py` GUI logic and hardware initialization.
*   **11:09:02 AM:** `README.md` comprehensive project documentation.
*   **12:07:16 PM:** `bmu_control.py` core BMU CAN communication and control.
*   **12:11:11 PM:** `test_bmu_control.py` introduction of a suite of BMU tests.
*   **12:20:18 PM:** `test_bmu_control.py` minor typing imports, suggesting refinement.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **HIL Testing Framework:** The changes consistently point to the development and refinement of a Hardware-in-the-Loop testing framework for Battery Management Units, encompassing GUI interaction, hardware control, CAN communication, and automated testing.
*   **Internationalization:** Explicit support for English and French is a recurring theme, found in the `i18n.py` file and `cSpell` configuration in `.vscode/settings.json`.
*   **Pytest-driven Testing:** Pytest is central to the testing strategy, indicated by the `pytest-html` generated report and dedicated Pytest files (`test_bmu_control.py`).
*   **CAN Communication:** The interaction with BMUs heavily relies on CAN communication, with specific scripts (`bmu_control.py`) handling DBC file parsing and message exchange.
*   **Structured Development Environment:** The `.vscode` configuration files highlight an emphasis on code quality (Black formatter, Pylance), documentation, and a well-defined development environment.
*   **Minor Re-saves:** Several instances of identical file content across different timestamps (`i18n.py`, `report.html`, `bmu_control.py`) suggest frequent saves, possibly due to automated formatting, IDE actions, or minor, non-functional edits.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **HIL Testing for BMUs:** The project is consistently focused on Hardware-in-the-Loop testing for Battery Management Units, utilizing CAN communication and DBC files.
*   **Pytest Framework:** Pytest is central to the testing strategy, with `runner.py` orchestrating `pytest HIL/` runs and `pytest-html` generating reports.
*   **Internationalization:** The GUI is designed to be bilingual (English and French), as seen in `i18n.py` and its usage in `runner.py`.
*   **VS Code as IDE:** The presence of `.vscode` configuration files (`settings.json`, `extensions.json`) indicates VS Code is the primary development environment, with specific formatters (Black), linters (Pylance), and Git tools configured.
*   **Repetitive Logging:** Several files (`i18n.py`, `report.html`, `bmu_control.py`, `test_bmu_control.py`) appear multiple times in the log with identical content across different timestamps. This suggests frequent saves, IDE operations, or version control system activity rather than distinct functional code changes during those specific logged instances.
*   **Structured Test Outputs:** The `test_bmu_control.py` examples demonstrate a pattern of printing formatted test results with clear "Requirement," "Read Value," "Valid Range," and "Status" sections, often using `print_test` helper.
