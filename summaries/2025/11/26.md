    *   Initially configured Python formatting to `ms-python.python` with `black` provider, setting a line length of 150.
    *   Updated to use the dedicated `ms-python.black-formatter` extension, clarifying that `editor.formatOnSave` is global.
    *   Adjusted the `black-formatter.args` to increase the line length from 150 to 160.
    *   Shell script formatting (`mkhl.shfmt`) remained consistent across all updates.
*   **`tools/can/can_macro_runner.py` (11/24/2025, 4:04:08 PM, 4:05:06 PM, 4:06:24 PM, 4:06:49 PM, 4:07:20 PM, 11/26/2025, 7:16:13 AM):**
    *   This file, responsible for executing PCAN-Explorer `.mcr` macros via `python-can` and a DBC file, was committed multiple times within a short period.
    *   The content across these timestamps appears identical, suggesting minor formatting changes, whitespace adjustments, or save operations without functional alterations being logged in the provided snippets. The core functionality for parsing macro operations (Send, Wait), resolving CAN IDs from DBC, and executing messages remained constant.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **11/24/2025, 4:03:57 PM - 4:10:50 PM:** Initial setup and configuration, including VS Code settings, core CAN utility development (`can_macro_runner.py`, `can_trc_logger.py`), definition of `ReportPrinter`, environment setup scripts (`setup_env.sh`, `can_setup.sh`), HIL test bench configuration (`eol_test_bench.yaml`), and the first version of the interactive test runner (`interactive_test.sh`). Also, the cyclic messages macro (`set_default_cyclic_msgs.mcr`) was defined.
*   **11/24/2025, 4:14:38 PM - 4:17:19 PM:** Extensive documentation updates across `README.md`, `tests/hil_tests/README.md`, `tools/can/README.md`, `src/scripts/hardware/eol_bench/README.md`, and `src/scripts/hardware/bmu/README.md`, providing an architectural overview, usage guides, and tool descriptions.
*   **11/24/2025, 4:19:52 PM - 4:26:03 PM:** Continued development and refinement of hardware control, particularly within `bmu_control.py` (BMU CAN communication) and `eth_relay.py` (Ethernet relay control), and the `eol_bench_controller.py` that utilizes these. These changes involve multiple re-saves of mostly identical content, suggesting iterative minor adjustments or formatting.
*   **11/25/2025, 7:17:14 AM - 7:21:11 AM:** Significant work on `test_bmu_control.py`, adding detailed, formatted logging and verification for numerous BMU tests (voltage, temperature, time retention). The multiple identical commits again suggest frequent saves.
*   **11/26/2025, 7:16:57 AM & 8:00:24 AM:** Configuration of `pytest.ini` for test discovery, options, and markers, followed by a detailed `TESTS_SUMMARY.md` documenting the logging enhancements for the `test_bmu_control.py` file. This indicates a finalization or major review of the testing output and framework.
*   **11/26/2025, 7:20:59 AM - 7:40:52 AM:** Updates to the `Layer.drawio` file, reflecting ongoing efforts to visually document the system architecture.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **CAN Communication Focus:** A central theme is the interaction with CAN bus, using DBC files for message encoding/decoding (`can_macro_runner.py`, `can_trc_logger.py`, `bmu_control.py`, `can_setup.sh`, `set_default_cyclic_msgs.mcr`). Python's `python-can` and `cantools` libraries are consistently used for this.
2.  **Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) Testing:** The project name itself, `HIL_Tester`, and numerous file paths (`tests/hil_tests`, `hil_scripts`) indicate a dedicated HIL testing framework. This involves controlling physical hardware (BMU, EOL test bench relays) and validating their behavior.
3.  **Pytest Framework:** `pytest` is the chosen framework for automated tests (`test_bmu_control.py`, `pytest.ini`, `tests/hil_tests/README.md`). Custom markers and fixtures are used to organize and enhance test execution.
4.  **Structured Configuration:** YAML files (`eol_test_bench.yaml`) are used for structured configuration, providing parameters for hardware control and test bench setup.
5.  **Shell Script Automation:** Bash scripts (`setup_env.sh`, `can_setup.sh`, `interactive_test.sh`) are heavily used for environment setup, CAN interface configuration, Docker management, and orchestrating test runs.
6.  **Detailed Logging and Reporting:** A strong emphasis on clear, formatted test output is evident through `report_printer_helper.py` and the `TESTS_SUMMARY.md`. Tests are designed to show requirements, measured values, and explicit pass/fail statuses, which is crucial for traceability and debugging in a HIL environment.
7.  **Frequent Iteration/Saving:** Multiple identical content commits within short timeframes (e.g., `can_macro_runner.py`, `bmu_control.py`, `test_bmu_control.py`, `Layer.drawio`) suggest continuous development, frequent saving, or minor non-functional changes (like whitespace or comments) being committed during active work.
8.  **Comprehensive Documentation:** Significant `README.md` updates across various directories (root, `tests/hil_tests`, `tools/can`, `src/scripts/hardware/eol_bench`, `src/scripts/hardware/bmu`) indicate an effort to maintain thorough and up-to-date project documentation, including architectural descriptions, setup guides, and tool usage.
9.  **BMU Specific Tests:** A large portion of the changes revolves around testing the Battery Management Unit, including reading voltages, temperatures, contactor states, time, fault flags, and configuration parameters.

## 10:12:10 AM
The project is a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testing framework for Battery Management Unit (BMU) validation, heavily relying on CAN bus communication and a layered architecture.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

The project experienced intense development over three days in late November 2025:
*   **November 24, 2025 (late afternoon)**: Initial development phase, laying down the foundation for CAN communication utilities (`can_macro_runner.py`, `can_trc_logger.py`), hardware control (`eol_bench_controller.py`, `eth_relay.py`), BMU interaction (`bmu_control.py`), environment setup scripts (`setup_env.sh`, `can_setup.sh`), core configurations (`settings.json`, `eol_test_bench.yaml`, `set_default_cyclic_msgs.mcr`), and initial project documentation (`README.md` and sub-READMEs).
*   **November 25, 2025 (early morning)**: Focused effort on implementing detailed BMU functional tests within `test_bmu_control.py`, including sophisticated output formatting and a new warning mechanism for unplaced sensors.
*   **November 26, 2025 (early morning/late morning)**: Concentrated on refining the project's testing infrastructure (`pytest.ini`), significantly enhancing the main `README.md` with a detailed layered architecture overview and command summaries, and documenting the test logging improvements (`TESTS_SUMMARY.md`), alongside updates to the architectural diagram.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **CAN-Centric HIL Testing:** The most prominent pattern is the focus on CAN bus communication for Hardware-in-the-Loop testing of a BMU. This is evident in the specific Python tools (`python-can`, `cantools`), shell scripts (`can_setup.sh`), macro files (`.mcr`), and `pytest` markers (`@pytest.mark.can`, `@pytest.mark.dbc`).
*   **Layered Architecture:** The project consciously adopts a layered architectural approach, with distinct layers for Configuration, HIL Scripts, GUI Runner, EOL Bench Control, CAN Communication, BMU-specific logic, and Pytest-based Tests. This is thoroughly documented in the main `README.md`.
*   **Automated Testing with Pytest:** Pytest is consistently used for automated validation. Tests are structured to provide clear, human-readable output, often including requirements and measured values for easy debugging and reporting.
*   **Comprehensive Documentation:** There is a strong, recurring emphasis on detailed documentation. The main `README.md` serves as a central hub, linking to numerous sub-`README.md` files that explain specific directories, tools, or testing guidelines. The addition of `TESTS_SUMMARY.md` further highlights this commitment to explaining changes and benefits.
*   **Hardware Abstraction:** A pattern of abstracting hardware control is visible, with high-level controllers (e.g., `eol_bench_controller.py`) interacting with lower-level drivers (e.g., `eth_relay.py`).
*   **Continuous Refinement and Readability:** Frequent minor code formatting, whitespace adjustments, and documentation rephrasing suggest an ongoing process of improving code quality, consistency, and clarity for maintainability. This is reflected in the `settings.json` updates for code formatting.
*   **Docker for Environment Management:** Docker and Docker Compose are consistently used for creating isolated and reproducible test environments, standardizing prerequisites and execution across different setups.
