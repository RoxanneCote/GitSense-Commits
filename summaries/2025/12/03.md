`c:\calogy_ws\HIL_Tester\tests\hil_tests\test_bmu_control.py` (Timestamp: 12/2/2025, 11:21:55 AM) outlines Pytest tests for a Battery Management Unit (BMU) control system. The file establishes various test thresholds and requirements in constants (e.g., `BATTERY_CURRENT_MAX`, `GLOBAL_STATE_REQUIREMENTS`), defining acceptable ranges and states for BMU parameters. It includes comprehensive tests for:
*   **Battery Voltage:** Checks if readings are within 40.0-60.0V.
*   **Load Voltage:** Tests availability and range (0.0-60.0V), including a specific test case to demonstrate a failure scenario.
*   **Coin Cell Presence:** Verifies that the BMU's Real-Time Clock (RTC) retains time after a 12V power cycle, indicating a functioning coin cell.
*   **BMU Temperatures:** Validates individual BMU sensor temperatures against a 15.0-32.0°C range, explicitly handling `-50.0°C` as a "sensor not placed" condition with a warning.
*   **Contactor Control:** Tests the ability to open and close BMU contactors, verifying the state changes.
The tests consistently use helper functions like `print_test` for standardized output formatting and assertions for validation, providing detailed output examples in their docstrings.

`c:\calogy_ws\HIL_Tester\tests\hil_tests\CAHIER_CHARGE_ISOLATION.md` (Timestamp: 12/2/2025, 12:22:19 PM) is a Markdown document detailing the functional, hardware, and methodological requirements for an **Isolation Resistance Variation Test Bench**. Its purpose is to simulate isolation faults on a BMU to verify its ability to measure `Rn` (negative pole to chassis) and `Rp` (positive pole to chassis) and detect isolation states (OK, Warning, Fault). Key points include:
*   Defining conditions for "Isolation OK" (resistance > nominal), "Warning" (< 500 Ω/V), and "Fault" (< 100 Ω/V).
*   Proposing an external circuit with switchable resistors (1 kΩ to 100 kΩ) to simulate different resistance values between battery poles and chassis.
*   Specifying target resistance values for simulation (e.g., 47 kΩ for OK, 4.7 kΩ for Fault) and electrical requirements such as supporting max battery voltage and operating in a floating IT reference.

`c:\calogy_ws\HIL_Tester\tools\can\set_default_cyclic_msgs.mcr` (Timestamp: 12/2/2025, 2:15:38 PM) is a PCAN-Explorer Macro File. It configures the default cyclic CAN messages for a `PROPA2_bms_config` system. The macro first enters configuration mode and then sequentially sends commands to set the transmission periods for various BMU-related messages. These messages include "Fault flags," "bmu_build_info," "gpio_state," "Config elec," "Bat limits," "SOC/SOH/Cap," "bmu_power," "energy_counters," different temperature readings (min/max/avg and all sensors), "bmu_time," "cmu_volt_min_max_avg," "cmu_temp_min_max_avg," "cmu_temp_all," "cmu_heaters_status," "current_raw," "soc_raw," and "clock_info." Transmission periods range from 100ms to 10000ms, with a consistent `Wait 100` delay between most commands.

`c:\calogy_ws\HIL_Tester\src\scripts\hardware\bmu\bmu_control.py` (Timestamp: 12/2/2025, 2:15:49 PM) defines the `BMUControl` Python class, which serves as the core CAN communication and DBC decoding interface for the BMU test bench. It uses `python-can` and `cantools` libraries. Key features include:
*   Initialization of the CAN bus and loading of a DBC file for message definitions.
*   A background receiver thread (`_rx_loop`) that continuously receives, decodes, and caches the latest CAN messages using a threading lock for thread-safety.
*   Methods to `read_message` and `read_mux_message` from the cache, with options for timeout and freshness.
*   Functions to `send_message` and `receive_message` over CAN.
*   A `send_periodic` method to automatically transmit messages at a given interval.
*   High-level control functions `open_contactor` and `close_contactor`, which send periodic `PROPA_bms_ctrl` messages with specific commands and can optionally verify the contactor's state.
The class is designed for robust and asynchronous interaction with the BMU, handling unknown message IDs and decoding errors.

A recurring pattern across these files is the strong focus on **Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testing for a Battery Management Unit (BMU)**, with **CAN communication** and **DBC message definitions** being central to the system's operation. The timestamps, all from December 2, 2025, indicate focused development activities or a snapshot of a particular stage.

## 7:39:12 AM
The provided log details recent updates across several files related to a HIL (Hardware-in-the-Loop) Tester for a BMU (Battery Management Unit).

On **12/2/2025 at 11:21:55 AM**, the file `c:\calogy_ws\HIL_Tester\tests\hil_tests\test_bmu_control.py` was updated. This Python file contains a suite of Pytest tests designed for the `BMUControl` class. Key updates include the definition of various test thresholds and requirements for battery current, global state, voltage (battery and load), coin cell time retention, BMU temperatures, and contactor control. Specific tests added or modified are:
*   `test_read_battery_voltage`: Ensures battery voltage is within a 40-60V range.
*   `test_read_load_voltage_failed`: A test case demonstrating a simulated out-of-range load voltage.
*   `test_read_load_voltage`: Verifies the load voltage remains within 0-60V.
*   `test_set_bmu_time`: Validates the BMU's real-time clock (RTC) functionality and coin cell presence by checking time retention after a power cycle, allowing for a maximum difference of 9 seconds.
*   `test_read_bmu_temperatures`: Checks BMU temperatures are within 15-32°C, and explicitly handles and warns about sensors reporting a "not placed" value of -50°C.
*   `test_open_contactor` and `test_close_contactor`: Integration tests to verify the proper opening and closing of BMU contactors.
A recurring pattern in this file is the use of `print_test` for standardized output formatting and clear "PASS"/"FAIL" indications within the test docstrings.

Later on **12/2/2025 at 12:22:19 PM**, the document `c:\calogy_ws\HIL_Tester\tests\hil_tests\CAHIER_CHARGE_ISOLATION.md` was updated. This Markdown document, a "Cahier des Charges" (specifications document), outlines the functional and hardware requirements for an isolation resistance variation test bench. Its main purpose is to simulate isolation faults between battery poles (+/-) and the chassis to verify the BMU's `Rn` (negative pole to chassis resistance) and `Rp` (positive pole to chassis resistance) measurement and fault detection algorithms. The document specifies three BMU states: "Isolation OK", "Warning" (< 500 Ω/V), and "Fault" (< 100 Ω/V). It details the required external circuit with switchable resistances (ranging from 100 kΩ to 1 kΩ/short-circuit) to simulate these states for a battery voltage of 40-60V, and outlines electrical requirements such as supporting maximum battery voltage, operating in a floating reference, and maintaining >1 kV isolation.

Then on **12/2/2025 at 2:15:38 PM**, the PCAN-Explorer macro file `c:\calogy_ws\HIL_Tester\tools\can\set_default_cyclic_msgs.mcr` was modified. This macro is designed to configure default cyclic CAN messages for a "PROPA2_bms_config" system. It systematically sends commands to set the transmission periods for numerous BMU-related messages, including fault flags (500ms), build info (10000ms), GPIO state (1000ms), electrical configuration (5000ms), battery limits (500ms), SOC/SOH/Capacity (500ms), BMU power (100ms), energy counters (10000ms), various temperature readings (5000ms or 10000ms), BMU time (10000ms), raw current (250ms), raw SOC (1000ms), and clock information (1000ms). The recurring pattern is a "Send AnyBus PROPA2_bms_config set_cyclic_msg" command followed by a `Wait 100` instruction.

Finally, at **12/2/2025 at 2:15:49 PM**, the Python script `c:\calogy_ws\HIL_Tester\src\scripts\hardware\bmu\bmu_control.py` received an update. This file defines the `BMUControl` class, which serves as a central component for CAN communication and DBC (CAN database) decoding within the HIL framework. The class initializes the CAN bus, loads the DBC file, and uses a background receiver thread (`_rx_loop`) with thread-safe locking to continuously cache the latest decoded CAN messages. Key methods include:
*   `read_message` and `read_mux_message`: Retrieve cached or wait for new CAN messages, with `read_mux_message` specifically handling multiplexed signals.
*   `send_message` and `send_periodic`: For transmitting single or periodically repeating CAN messages.
*   `open_contactor` and `close_contactor`: Implementations to send periodic CAN commands to control the BMU's contactors, with optional verification steps.
The `BMUControl` class is crucial for enabling the interaction between the HIL tester and the physical BMU hardware, facilitating both monitoring and control aspects of the tests. The update log for this file cuts off before the full `open_close_contractor` method, suggesting it may have been an incomplete or ongoing change.

**Overall Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
The core focus across all these changes is on testing and controlling a **BMU (Battery Management Unit)** within a **HIL (Hardware-in-the-Loop) Tester** framework. There is a strong emphasis on **CAN communication** for interaction with the BMU, with the `.mcr` file configuring cyclic messages and the `bmu_control.py` script handling the Python-level CAN interface and DBC decoding. Key parameters like **voltage, current, temperature, and isolation resistance** are consistently targeted for monitoring and testing, indicating a comprehensive approach to BMU validation. The timestamps show these changes occurring on the same day, suggesting a concentrated development effort.
