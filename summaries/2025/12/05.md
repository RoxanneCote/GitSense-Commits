# Activity Summary for 12/5/2025

## 8:55:26 AM
The log details a series of code changes within the `c:\calogy_ws\HIL_Tester` project, primarily focusing on testing utilities and Battery Management Unit (BMU) control tests. All changes occurred on **12/5/2025**.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\calogy_ws\HIL_Tester\tests\helpers\test_dbc_path.py` (Timestamp: 12/5/2025, 7:56:03 AM)**
    *   This file introduces a Pytest module (`test_dbc_path.py`) to validate DBC (Database CAN) file paths.
    *   The `test_dbc_path_passed_correctly` function checks if a DBC file path provided via the command line (`--dbc-path`) exists and has the correct `.dbc` extension. It includes informative print statements for validation status.

*   **`c:\calogy_ws\HIL_Tester\tests\helpers\report_printer_helper.py`**
    *   **Initial change (12/5/2025, 8:18:33 AM):** A `ReportPrinter` class is added, containing a static method `print_test` to format and print test results (title, requirements, individual results with pass/fail status). A `verify_range` static method is also introduced, along with a functional alias `print_test` outside the class. There was a typo in `verify_range` (`limir_max`).
    *   **Minor correction (12/5/2025, 8:21:47 AM):** The typo `limir_max` in the `verify_range` static method is corrected to `limit_max`.
    *   **Documentation and cleanup (12/5/2025, 8:38:57 AM):** A docstring is added to the `verify_range` static method, explaining its purpose. The redundant functional `print_test` alias defined outside the `ReportPrinter` class is removed, streamlining the use to `ReportPrinter.print_test`.

*   **`c:\calogy_ws\HIL_Tester\tests\hil_tests\test_bmu_control.py`**
    *   **Initial implementation (12/5/2025, 8:21:12 AM):** This file is introduced, defining Pytest tests for a `BMUControl` class. It sets up numerous test thresholds and requirements (e.g., `BATTERY_CURRENT_MAX`, `GLOBAL_STATE_REQUIREMENTS`, `BMU_TEMP_MIN/MAX`). Several tests are implemented, including:
        *   `test_read_battery_voltage`: Checks battery voltage against defined limits, initially using the functional `print_test` (from `report_printer_helper`).
        *   `test_read_load_voltage_failed` and `test_read_load_voltage`: Check load voltage, primarily using direct `print` statements for reporting.
        *   `test_set_bmu_time`: Verifies coin cell presence and RTC time retention after a power cycle, also using direct `print` statements.
        *   `test_read_bmu_temperatures`: Checks BMU temperatures, handling "not placed" sensors, using direct `print` statements.
        *   `test_open_contactor`: Tests opening contactors, using the functional `print_test`.
        *   `test_close_contactor`: (Partial entry) Initiates testing closing contactors.
    *   **Refactoring `print_test` usage (12/5/2025, 8:21:27 AM):** The `test_read_battery_voltage` function is updated to explicitly use `ReportPrinter.print_test` instead of the global `print_test` alias, starting a pattern of consistent reporting.
    *   **Continued refactoring (12/5/2025, 8:22:55 AM):** The `test_set_bmu_time` function is updated to use `ReportPrinter.print_test`.
    *   **Further refactoring (12/5/2025, 8:24:24 AM):** `test_read_bmu_temperatures` and `test_open_contactor` are updated to use `ReportPrinter.print_test`, extending the consistent reporting pattern.
    *   **No functional change (12/5/2025, 8:28:40 AM):** The content is identical to the previous entry, indicating a save without further code modification.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent Timestamp:** All changes are recorded on `12/5/2025`, suggesting a concentrated development session.
*   **Test-Driven Development:** The logs primarily show the creation and refinement of Pytest-based hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) tests, particularly for a Battery Management Unit (BMU).
*   **Standardized Reporting:** A clear pattern emerges in `test_bmu_control.py` of migrating from ad-hoc `print` statements or a functional alias (`print_test`) to the structured `ReportPrinter.print_test` utility for consistent, formatted test output. This refactoring demonstrates an effort to improve report generation.
*   **Detailed Test Coverage:** The `test_bmu_control.py` file covers various BMU functionalities, including voltage readings, time retention (coin cell presence), temperature monitoring, and contactor control, each with defined requirements and expected output examples.
*   **Threshold-Based Assertions:** Tests frequently define `MIN` and `MAX` values for various parameters (e.g., `BATTERY_VOLTAGE_MIN/MAX`, `BMU_TEMP_MIN/MAX`) and assert that readings fall within these ranges.
*   **Documentation:** Python docstrings are used to explain the purpose of modules, classes, and functions, including example outputs for test functions. The addition of a docstring to `verify_range` further emphasizes this.
