    *   Initially committed at 10:58:37 AM, this file defines the `EOLBenchController` class, which manages an End-of-Line (EOL) BMU test bench. It reads configuration from a YAML file, connects to an `EthRelay` module, and provides high-level methods to control 12V/48V BMU power and multiple loads.
    *   Subsequent commits at 10:58:43 AM and 10:59:04 AM involved minor refactoring of method names to ensure consistent casing (e.g., `turn_off_12V_BMU` became `turn_off_12v_bmu`, `turn_off_48V_BMU` became `turn_off_48v_bmu`).

*   **`c:\calogy_ws\HIL_Tester\src\scripts\hardware\bmu\bmu_config.py`**:
    *   At 10:59:27 AM, this file was introduced, defining a `BMUConfig` dataclass. This class serves as a configuration container for initializing a `BMUControl` interface, specifying CAN bus parameters like channel, bus type, DBC path, bitrate, and optional additional configuration.

    *   This file, first seen at 11:00:47 AM, implements `MacroRunner` for executing PCAN-Explorer `.mcr` macro files using `python-can` and a DBC database. It includes parsing logic for `Send` and `Wait` operations, resolving CAN arbitration IDs, and executing these operations on a CAN bus.
    *   Between 11:01:41 AM and 11:03:11 AM, several docstrings were added or refined for the `SendOp`, `WaitOp`, `MacroRunner` classes, and the `open_bus` static method, significantly improving code documentation and clarity. A minor change involved the removal of `pass` from `MacroParseError` at one point, indicating some internal cleanup.

*   **`c:\calogy_ws\HIL_Tester\docker\Dockerfile`**:
    *   At 11:05:00 AM, a Dockerfile was added to containerize the HIL Tester environment. It uses `python:3.11-slim`, installs system dependencies (including `can-utils`), creates a `hil_tester` user with sudo, installs Oh My Zsh, and sets up the Python environment by installing `requirements.txt`. The entrypoint defaults to `zsh`. A subsequent commit at 11:05:19 AM showed no functional changes.

    *   Initially, at 11:50:16 AM, this file defines the `BMUControl` class, a central component for CAN communication and DBC decoding for the BMU test bench. It manages sending/receiving CAN messages, decoding them, and caching signals. Key functionalities include a background receiver thread, methods for reading/sending messages, printing available DBC messages, sending periodic messages, and controlling/verifying BMU contactor states. It also includes methods to read BMU temperatures, battery voltage, and load voltage.
    *   A significant update at 12:33:24 PM focused on enhancing the docstrings for `read_message`, `send_message`, and `receive_message` methods, providing more detailed explanations of arguments and return types.
