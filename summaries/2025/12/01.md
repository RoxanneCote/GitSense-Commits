    *   This file, responsible for Modbus CRC16 checksum calculation, saw a stylistic change where local variables `crcHigh` and `crcLow` were renamed to `crc_high` and `crc_low` respectively, adhering to Python's snake_case convention. Earlier entries on this file show no functional changes.
*   **`c:\calogy_ws\HIL_Tester\src\scripts\hardware\eol_bench\__init__.py`**:
    *   **Timestamp: 11/28/2025, 10:52:47 AM**

    *   **Timestamp: 11/28/2025, 10:59:04 AM** (and prior entries at 10:58:37 AM, 10:58:43 AM)
    *   The `EOLBenchController` class was established to manage an EOL BMU test bench. It initializes an `EthRelay` based on YAML configuration (IP, port, relay mapping). Subsequent changes involved renaming several high-level control methods like `turn_off_12V_BMU` to `turn_off_12v_bmu` and similar changes for 48V BMU control (e.g., `turn_off_48V_BMU` to `turn_off_48v_bmu`). This was a consistency update to use snake_case for method names. The internal `actions` dictionary retains the original key names.
*   **`c:\calogy_ws\HIL_Tester\src\scripts\hardware\bmu\bmu_config.py`**:
    *   **Timestamp: 11/28/2025, 10:59:27 AM**
    *   A `BMUConfig` dataclass was introduced to centralize configuration parameters for the `BMUControl` interface, including CAN channel, bus type, DBC file path, bitrate, and optional additional configurations.
*   **`c:\calogy_ws\HIL_Tester\src\scripts\hil_runner\localization.py`**:
    *   **Timestamp: 11/28/2025, 10:59:53 AM**

    *   **Timestamp: 11/28/2025, 11:03:11 AM** (and prior entries at 11:00:47 AM, 11:01:41 AM, 11:02:02 AM, 11:02:22 AM)
    *   The `MacroRunner` class was developed to parse and execute PCAN-Explorer `.mcr` macro files using `python-can` and a DBC file. It defines `SendOp` and `WaitOp` for macro commands. Subsequent changes primarily involved adding docstrings to classes (`SendOp`, `WaitOp`, `MacroParseError`, `MacroRunner`) and methods (`open_bus`), improving code readability and maintainability. A minor stylistic fix was removing `pass` from an empty exception class.
*   **`c:\calogy_ws\HIL_Tester\docker\Dockerfile`**:
    *   **Timestamp: 11/28/2025, 11:05:00 AM**
    *   A Dockerfile was created to set up a containerized environment based on `python:3.11-slim`. It installs system dependencies, creates a `hil_tester` user with sudo, installs Oh My Zsh with plugins, and sets up the Python environment by installing dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

    *   The `BMUControl` class manages CAN communication with a BMU, including DBC decoding and a background thread for message caching. It provides methods for sending/receiving messages, controlling contactors (`open_contactor`, `close_contactor`), and reading BMU data (temperatures, voltages). Significant updates involved adding comprehensive docstrings to methods like `read_message`, `send_message`, and `receive_message` to explain their functionality, parameters, and returns. A new method, `read_mux_message`, was introduced to specifically handle reading multiplexed CAN messages from the cache, ensuring data is filtered by a specified multiplexer field and value.
*   **`c:\calogy_ws\HIL_Tester\tests\hil_tests\test_bmu_control.py`**:
    *   **Timestamp: 11/28/2025, 12:40:29 PM**
    *   This file contains Pytest-based HIL tests for the `BMUControl` class. Tests cover battery voltage, load voltage (both pass and fail scenarios), coin cell presence (RTC time retention across power cycles), BMU temperatures, and contactor open/close operations. Each test includes clear requirements and uses a `print_test` helper for standardized output. Subsequent entries are identical, indicating no further changes to the test logic within the provided log.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Focused Development:** Changes occurred in concentrated bursts on 11/28/2025 and 12/1/2025, suggesting dedicated development efforts on these days.
*   **Code Quality and Documentation:** A consistent effort to add or refine docstrings for Python classes and methods is observed across `can_macro_runner.py` and `bmu_control.py`, indicating a strong focus on code readability and maintainability. Stylistic adjustments, such as variable renaming to snake_case (`modbus_crc.py`) and method name casing (`eol_bench_controller.py`), reinforce adherence to coding standards like PEP8.
*   **HIL Testing Infrastructure:** The logs show a coherent development path for a HIL testing system, with components for Modbus-based relay control (`modbus_crc.py`, `eol_bench_controller.py`), CAN bus communication and DBC parsing (`bmu_config.py`, `bmu_control.py`, `can_macro_runner.py`), and a testing framework (`test_dbc_path.py`, `test_bmu_control.py`).

        *   `test_read_bmu_temperatures` for sensor readings, noting unplaced sensors.
        *   `test_open_contactor` and `test_close_contactor` for contactor state verification.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/1/2025, 12:04:32 PM**, **12/1/2025, 1:16:42 PM**, **12/1/2025, 1:21:54 PM** (No changes from previous logs).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **HIL Test Automation Focus:** The recurring theme is the development and refinement of a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testing framework. This is evident in file paths like `HIL_Tester`, `eol_bench`, `bmu`, and `hil_runner`, and the content of the scripts which control hardware (relays) and communicate via CAN.
*   **CAN Communication Emphasis:** A significant portion of the changes revolves around CAN bus communication. This includes the `BMUControl` class for sending/receiving/decoding CAN messages using DBC files, and `can_macro_runner.py` for executing CAN macros.
*   **Modbus Integration:** The `modbus_crc.py` and `eol_bench_controller.py` files indicate integration with Modbus over Ethernet for relay control, suggesting a mixed-protocol hardware interaction setup.
*   **Documentation and Code Quality:** Multiple updates involve adding or refining docstrings and variable renaming (`modbus_crc.py`, `can_macro_runner.py`, `bmu_control.py`) to improve code readability and maintainability. The `README.md` for shell formatting also points to a focus on consistent code style.
*   **Incremental Development:** Changes occur over a short period (November 28th and December 1st, 2025), with frequent saves or commits, often involving small, iterative improvements (e.g., docstring additions, minor refactorings) followed by more substantial feature additions (e.g., `read_mux_message`). Many consecutive log entries show identical code, indicating minor non-functional changes or saves not captured as distinct code modifications by the logger.
*   **Containerization:** The `Dockerfile` indicates that the HIL testing environment is containerized, ensuring consistency and ease of deployment for the testing tools.
